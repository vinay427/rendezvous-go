# rendezvous-go
My first Go project!
Backend for a meeting place calculator written in Go (uses some mapping APIs)

### Plans
Currently planning on using some Google Maps APIs to process data and return results. The boilerplate code is mostly in place, with work needed to integrate the APIs properly.
